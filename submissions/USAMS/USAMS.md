The University Student Attendance Monitoring System (USAMS) is a system for tracking attendance at each event that takes place at the university. This reduces the effort that employees must expend in tracking down and storing that information permanently. Our attendance tracking system is not just a tool; it's a transformative solution that empowers universities to usher in a new era of efficiency and accuracy in event management. By simplifying attendance tracking, we're not just saving time; we're fostering an environment where university staff can focus on what truly matters nurturing academic excellence and creating memorable experiences for students and faculty.
